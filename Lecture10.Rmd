# The logic of sets


A presence table will be like a truth table, except we will use it to study the algebra of sets. Recall $A \subset B$ if whenever $x \in A$, then $x \in B$. Think of the conditional $\to$. We can then construct the presence table for $A \subset B$ as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c | c ||c}\hline
$A$ & $B$ & $(A \subset B)$ \\ 
\hline
P & P &  1\\ 
P & A &  0\\
A & P &  1\\
A & A &  1\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

In the first two columns, $P$ means some $x$ is present in $A$ and $A$ (for absent) means $x$ is not in $A$. 1 under the column for $A \subset B)$ means the sentence "A is a subset of B" is true. 0 under the column for $A \subset B$ means that on that row the sentence "A is a subset of B" is false.
