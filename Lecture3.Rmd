# Sentential Logic: Arguments and Inference

>- One feature of a natural language like English is that we use it to communicate with others; and especially to offer them reasons why they can or should accept whatever we are saying. 

>- The reasons we give, hoping to convince or persuade someone to accept a claim, are called \textcolor{red}{premises}. We hope that if someone believes the premises then they will \textcolor{red}{infer} or draw \textcolor{red}{the conclusion}, which we claim. 

>- This set of sentences consisting of (1) premises and (2) a conclusion which are connected by (3) inference is called an \textcolor{red}{argument}.

>- We wish to use sentential logic to represent the structure of \textcolor{red}{good} arguments made in natural language.

# From Sentential Logic to Deductive Logic

>- The process of drawing or inferring a conclusion is called \textcolor{red}{deduction} if the premises \textcolor{red}{entail} the conclusion. 

>- To understand what the word "entail" means, we need the truth table for the truth function $(p \to q)$, which is read as "If $p$, then $q$". See \textcolor{red}{Homework 2} for why $(p \to q)$ is truth-functionally equivalent to $(\lnot p \vee q)$.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c | c || c}\hline
$p$ & $q$ & $(p \to q)$ \\
\hline
\textcolor{blue}{1} & \textcolor{blue}{1} &   \textcolor{blue}{1} \\
\textcolor{red}{1} & \textcolor{red}{0} &   \textcolor{red}{0} \\
\textcolor{blue}{0} & \textcolor{blue}{1} &   \textcolor{blue}{1} \\
\textcolor{blue}{0} & \textcolor{blue}{0} &   \textcolor{blue}{1} \\
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

# From Sentential Logic to Deductive Logic

>- We say that a formula $F$ \textcolor{red}{entails} another formula $G$ in sentential logic just in case $(F \to G)$ is a \textcolor{red}{tautology}.

>- From the truth table for $(p \to q)$, we see that $(F \to G)$ is false just in case $F$ is true \textcolor{red}{and} the formula $G$ is false. This is the \textcolor{red}{powerful idea} behind deductive logic.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c | c || c}\hline
$p$ & $q$ & $(p \to q)$ \\
\hline
\textcolor{blue}{1} & \textcolor{blue}{1} &   \textcolor{blue}{1} \\
\textcolor{red}{1} & \textcolor{red}{0} &   \textcolor{red}{0} \\
\textcolor{blue}{0} & \textcolor{blue}{1} &   \textcolor{blue}{1} \\
\textcolor{blue}{0} & \textcolor{blue}{0} &   \textcolor{blue}{1} \\
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


# From Sentential Logic to Deductive Logic

>- A \textcolor{red}{deductive logic} is a logic where \textcolor{red}{the relation of inference} between the premises and the conclusion is \textcolor{red}{entailment}, i.e., the premises entail the conclusion.

>- Another way to think of a deductive logic is that a deductive logic is a logic of \textcolor{red}{truth-preserving reasoning}. With a deductive logic it is \textcolor{red}{impossible} to begin with true premises then reason to, or infer, false conclusions!

>- Deductive logic is great for mathematics (where almost every sentence is either a theorem or refutable) but deductive logic has limited use in experimental science, even real life! (More of this later.)

>- Sentential Logic can be turned into a deductive logic by adding \textcolor{red}{rules of inference} that preserve truth.

# From Sentential Logic to Deductive Logic

>- The rules of inference that preserve truth are those rules of inference for which the relation between the premises and conclusion in an argument is entailment.

>- \textcolor{red}{Some} rules of inference, which preserve truth, are:\begin{enumerate}
\item From a formula $F$, infer $(F \vee G)$ for any formula $G$.
\item From a formula $\lnot F$ and $(F \vee G)$, infer $G$.
\end{enumerate}
>- Verify that $(F \to (F \vee G))$ and $((\lnot F \to (F \vee G)) \to G)$ are tautologies.

# From Sentential Logic to Deductive Logic

>- Intuitively, these rules of inference make sense when we think about them using sentences in English. 

>- Consider the first rule of inference, which says from a formula $F$, infer $(F \vee G)$ for any formula $G$. Here is an \textcolor{red}{instance} of this argument form: \begin{itemize} \item[1.] I will have bacon for breakfast. \item[$\therefore$2.] Either I will have bacon for breakfast or I will have toast for breakfast. \end{itemize}

>- Now consider the second rule of inference, which says from a formula $\lnot F$ and $(F \vee G)$, infer $G$. Here is an \textcolor{red}{instance} of this argument form: \begin{itemize} \item[1.] Either I will have bacon for breakfast or I will have toast for breakfast. \item[2.] I will not have bacon for breakfast. \item[$\therefore$3.] I will have toast for breakfast.\end{itemize}

# Validity and Soundness

>- The goal of using deductive logic is to give "good" arguments.

>- We will use two criteria to evaluate arguments for their "goodness". One criterion is called \textcolor{red}{validity}, the other criterion is called \textcolor{red}{soundness}.

>- An argument is \textcolor{red}{valid} if the conclusion is inferred from the premises using a truth-preserving rule of inference. The following are all equivalent ways of saying that an argument is valid:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Any truth value assignment that makes the premises true must make the conclusion true.
\item No truth value assignment makes the premises true and the conclusion false.
\item It is impossible to assign truth values to the premises in such a way that all the premises are true and the conclusion is false.
\item If the conclusion is false, at least one of the premises is false.
\end{enumerate}


# Validity and Soundness

>- Let me stress that the validity of an argument is a \textcolor{red}{formal} notion. This means that whether an argument is valid depends on (1) the \textcolor{red}{formulas} in question and (2) whether \textcolor{red}{the formulas} in the premises entail the \textcolor{red}{the formula} in the conclusion. 

>- Because validity is a formal notion, we say that \textcolor{red}{an argument in English} is valid just in case it is an \textcolor{red}{instance} of a \textcolor{red}{argument form} in deductive logic in which the rule of inference is truth-preserving.

>- Consider the argument form which says that from a formula $\lnot F$ and $(F \vee G)$, infer $G$. An \textcolor{red}{instance} of this argument form is:\begin{itemize} \item[1.] Either I will have bacon for breakfast or I will have toast. \item[2.] I will not have bacon. \item[$\therefore$3.] I will have toast for breakfast.\end{itemize}

>- Another \textcolor{red}{instance} of this argument form is:\begin{itemize}\item[1.] Either $2 + 2 = 5$ or the moon is made of green cheese. \item[2.] $2 + 2 \neq 5$ \item[$\therefore$3.] The moon is made of green cheese. \end{itemize}

# Validity and Soundness

>- Wait. What? 

>- That is the right reaction here.

>- Although both instances of the argument form are valid, one of the premises in the second instance is \textcolor{red}{false}. This is the premise that says "Either $2 + 2 = 5$ or the moon is made of green cheese."

>- An argument that is (1) valid and (2) all the premises are true is a \textcolor{red}{sound argument}.

>- Convince yourself that deductive logic cannot help you to determine whether an argument in English is sound. Bummer! Whether the premises are true relies on domain knowledge, i.e., knowledge of a specific, specialized discipline or field; it does not depend on logic.
