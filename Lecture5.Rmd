# Inference in Quantified Relational Logic

>- In order to do inference in quantified relational logic we need the notions of (1) the \textcolor{red}{scope of a quantifier} and (2) an \textcolor{red}{instance} of a formula in quantified relational logic.

>- The \textcolor{red}{scope of quantifier} are all the free variables, which it binds, in a formula.

>- An \textcolor{red}{instance} of a formula in quantified relational logic is a formula that is obtained by freeing a bound variable within the scope of a quantifier and \textcolor{red}{uniformly replacing} every occurrence of this free variable by a constant.

>- For each of these formulas: what is the scope of each quantifier? Provide an instance of each formula.\begin{itemize} \item[1] $(\exists x (Gx))$ \item[2] $(\forall x (\lnot Gx))$ \item[3] $(\forall x ((\lnot Qx) \to (\exists y (Sxy))))$  \item[4] $(\forall x \forall y((Lxy) \to (\exists z((Lxz) \wedge (Lzy)))))$ \end{itemize}

# Inference in Quantified Relational Logic

>- Finally we can state the inference rules of quantified relational logic which turn it into a deductive logic.\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] All the truth-preserving rules of inference covered in sentential logic are truth-preserving rules of inference in quantified relational logic.
\item[2.] From an instance of a formula $\mathcal{F}$ infer $(\exists x \mathcal{F})$ where the formula $\mathcal{F}$ is the result of uniformly replacing with variable $x$ any constant in $\mathcal{F}$. This rule is known as \textcolor{red}{Existential Generalization}.
\end{itemize}

>- Here is an instance of an inference that uses Existential Generalization:
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] Hypatia is wise. $(Wh)$
\item[$\therefore$2.] Someone is wise. $(\exists x (Wx))$ (From 1 and By Existential Generalization)
\end{itemize}

# Inference in Quantified Relational Logic

>- Inference rules continued from previous slide:\begin{itemize}
\item[3.] From $\forall x \mathcal{F}$ you may infer any of its instances. This rule is known as \textcolor{red}{Universal Instantiation}
\end{itemize}

>- Here is an instance of an inference that uses Universal Instantiation.\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] All logicians are wise. $(\forall x( Lx \to Wx))$
\item[$\therefore$2.] If Ruth Barcan Marcus is a logician, then she is wise. $(La \to Wa)$ (From 1 and By Universal Instantiation)
\end{itemize}

# Inference in Quantified Relational Logic

\begin{itemize}

\item[4.] From $\exists x \mathcal{F}$, you may suppose that $\mathcal{F}(a)$ and use $\mathcal{F}(a)$ together with other premises to infer a \textcolor{red}{sentence} $G$ using other truth preserving rules of inference. Here $\mathcal{F}(a)$ is the result of uniformly replacing every free occurrence of $x$ in $\mathcal{F}$ with an arbitrary constant $a$, \textcolor{red}{which has not occurred before}. This rule is known as \textcolor{red}{Existential Supposition}.
\end{itemize}

>- Here is an instance of \textcolor{red}{Existential Supposition}:
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] Someone is wise. $(\exists x (Wx))$
\item[2.] Suppose Cavendish is wise. $(Wc)$ (From 1. and Existential Supposition)
\item[3.] Wise people use logic. (Additional Premise)
\item[$\therefore$ 4.] Cavendish uses logic. (G)
\end{itemize}

>- These are the only truth-preserving rules of inference that we will avail for ourselves in quantified relational logic but other rules of inference can be derived from these.

# Models and Counterexamples

>- We know why the truth-preserving rules of sentential logic are truth-preserving. 

>- Since $\exists$ and $\forall$ are \textcolor{red}{not truth-functional}, in order to say why the rule \textcolor{red}{Existential Generalization}, the rule \textcolor{red}{Universal Instantiation} and the rule \textcolor{red}{Existential Supposition} are truth-preserving rules of inference, we need to discuss the semantics, interpretation or meaning of \textcolor{red}{sentences} in quantified relational logic.

>- This will require a tool which we will call a \textcolor{red}{model} or \textcolor{red}{intended interpretation} of some sentences in quantified relational logic.
